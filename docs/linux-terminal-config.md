## 3. Install Oh My Zsh

This one is a go to if you want you session to feel more personnal but also more productive with some of the best plugins

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

## 4. Recommended .zshrc Settings

This is my favorite setup oh-my-zsh, simple, clean and beautiful theme + some of the best plugins, check oh-my-zsh/plugins repo for more info 

Shout out to "colored-man-pages" and "command-not-found" which are actually pretty usefull

```zsh
ZSH_THEME="candy"
plugins=(git docker kubectl terraform aws colored-man-pages command-not-found copypath copyfile cp genpass web-search node npm nvm)
source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh
```
